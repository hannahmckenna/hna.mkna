       ABOUT ME 
    </h1>
</div>



    <div class="body-text">
        <p>I am currently studying as an incoming Final year Graphic Design student in The National College of Art and Design (NCAD). </p>
        <p>My favourite projects are always those that start at one point and finish somewhere completely different.</p>
        <p>The developmental process is something that I thoroughly enjoy. Having the ability to think through an idea and it to its conclusion is something that I love and is something that excites me. Determination and work ethic gave me the ability to continue to explore and push an idea to fruition.</p>
        <p>The main focus of my work, as of recent has been photography based. Using both analogue and digital photography I find that I can best communicate my concepts and ideas through this medium. I have also been working on typographic work and attempting to find styles and techniques that best suit me and my work. </p>
        <p>My current goal for this upcoming year is to find an Internship in which I can grow and learn from those in a career that I wish to pursue. I hope to be in an environment that I can contribute to, gain experience in and meet people I can learn from. </p>
        <p>If you would like to contact me I have linked my Email and Instagram below and would be delighted to hear from you!</p>
