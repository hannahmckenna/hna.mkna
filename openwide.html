  <p>A project centring around process.</p>
  <p>I came across old E-1 Slides of images my grandad had taken throughout his dental career.</p>
  <p>Finding these slides inspired me to recreate the memories they contained by going through the same processes he did while capturing these images.</p>
  <p>When recreating his process I used the same film stock my grandad did in the 1970s.</p>
  <p>I took photos of teeth on the very same camera he used and I tried my best to emulate what I imagined his process would have been.</p>
  <p>While looking at the images I fund that the models poses naturally mirrored that of my grandads patients.</p>
  <p>I had unintentionally captured images that directly correlated to his through following his process.</p>
